// A HexVec uses a hexagonal basis defined such that, from hexagon centre-to-centre, (h, k) represents two vectors with h rotated 0 rad and k rotated +Ï€/6 rad. Details below:
// A hexagonal space may be represented succinctly with just two basis vectors:
// Consider a line drawn through two opposite vertices of a hexagon (i.e. its major diagonal) such that this line is horizontal
// Consider then on the right side of the hexagon two additional hexagons, overlapping on the right upper and right lower edges
// Then draw a vector from the centre of the reference hexagon to the centre of each hexagon to the right; this now forms a complete basis, usually marked as (h, k)
// Reference: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_Island/publication/320407497/figure/fig2/AS:551016690970625@1508384024782/a-Real-space-graphene-lattice-with-primitive-vectors-a-1-and-a-2-The-lattice-has-a.png
// This also works if instead of being horizontal, the major diagonal is vertical, and the overlapping hexagons are directly to the right and to the upper right
// Reference: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324477876/figure/fig1/AS:614570607538178@1523536459336/Two-basis-vectors-a-1-a-2-and-one-generating-vector-A-for-a-hexagonal-lattice-In.png
// While it is also possible to consider this basis as originating from a vertex of the hexagon and pointed at its minor diagonals, it's not individual vertices that matter in this puzzle but entire hexagons,
//   so it's easier to use the centre-of-hexagon definition
// Note that the input to this puzzle designates east, west, north(west/east), and south(west/east)
// Using an (h, k) where h represents hexagons to the east and k represents hexagons to the northeast results in a relatively simple coordinate system:
// E:  (  1,  0)
// W:  ( -1,  0)
// NE: (  0,  1)
// SW: (  0, -1)
// NW: ( -1,  1)
// SE: (  1, -1)
// In this way, any hexagonal tile may be represented as a vector from (0, 0) to (h, k), and moving from tile to tile is merely linear algebra
